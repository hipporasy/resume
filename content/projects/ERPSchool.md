I randomly check the SketchAppResource seeing UI designed by [Syal](https://www.sketchappsources.com/contributor/syaluiux) and I found that it is very nice for to work on. I decided to make it happen in Flutter. I even do the `live coding` in YouTube for this project. Though, it is not completed but some UI look pretty good.
