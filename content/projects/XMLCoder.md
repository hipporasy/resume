XMLCoder is my one of the hardest library I had ever made back in 2018. The library is to connect to library called `lib2xml` and after parse from lib2xml I have to decode & encode it back using the existed apple foundation framework Decodable & Codable. Which meant I have to create something like JSONDecoder but named it as XMLDecoder in order to achieve the same thing as JSONDecoder.
