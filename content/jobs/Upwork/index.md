- Work with a company called [WeAreMore](https://wearemore.life), it is a Therapist App; however, I didn't start from scratch, I just happened to maintain and add more features to the project.
- Work with a company called [Lighthouse Portal](https://lighthouse-portal.com), it is a Health Progress App; same way as WeAreMore, I didn't start from scratch. I have added multiple features and made a big changed in the api connections.
